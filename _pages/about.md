### About Me

I am **Juan Merizalde, PhD**, an independent researcher studying **militant and sub-state violence**, with a **regional focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan**.  

My work explores patterns of insurgent cooperation, ideological convergence, and state-society interactions within irregular conflict environments.  

This site serves as an open-access platform for sharing my research, data projects, and theoretical insights related to conflict and terrorism studies.
