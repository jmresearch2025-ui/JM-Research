---

ðŸ‘‹ I am **Juan Merizalde, PhD**, an independent researcher specializing in **militant and sub-state violence**, with a regional focus on **Afghanistan and Pakistan (AFPAK)**.

My research explores insurgent cooperation, ideological convergence, and the behavioral patterns of non-state armed groups. I draw from **rational choice theory**, **convergent conflict theory**, and **neutralization theory** to explain how militant organizations form alliances, adapt, and evolve under pressure.

This website shares my research, data projects, and commentary on conflict, terrorism, and security studies.
