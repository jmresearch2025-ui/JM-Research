Welcome to my research site.

Iâ€™m **Juan Merizalde, PhD**, an independent researcher focusing on militant and sub-state violence, with a regional specialization in Afghanistan and Pakistan (AFPAK).  

This platform hosts my work, including publications, datasets, teaching materials, and commentary on emerging trends in irregular warfare, insurgency dynamics, and regional security issues.
